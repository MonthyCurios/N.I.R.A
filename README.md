## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Voice Recognition

Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to process spoken commands. The system captures audio input, converts it to text, and executes the corresponding action.

### Text-to-Speech

The `pyttsx3` library is used to convert text responses into spoken words, enabling natural and clear communication.

### Weather Information

Fetches weather details for a specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can request current weather conditions and forecasts.

### Joke Fetching

Integrates with an online joke API to provide random jokes for user entertainment and engagement.

### Timer and Alarm

Users can set and manage timers and alarms, with options for customizing alert sounds and durations.

### Google Custom Search

Performs search queries and retrieves results using the Google Custom Search API. This feature allows users to obtain information from the web directly.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Employs `nltk` and `sklearn` for processing natural language and classifying user intents, enabling sophisticated understanding and responses.

### Bluetooth and NFC Scanning

Scans for and identifies nearby Bluetooth and NFC devices. This feature helps in interacting with various smart devices.

### Dictionary Lookup

Provides definitions, synonyms, and usage examples for words using `PyDictionary`.

### Currency Conversion

Converts amounts between different currencies using the `forex-python` library, assisting users in financial transactions.

### News Retrieval

Retrieves top news headlines from various sources using the NewsAPI, keeping users updated with current events.

### Convertations

Added the ability to have a decent conversation with the AI.

### Computer Vision

It can understand what its seeing and help u either find info about the object or help you solve the problem (still unter deverlopment it has a lot of errors)

### Rock Paper Scissors

you can play rock paper scissors with the AI!

### Coin Flip

You can make Coin flips idk i just felt it would be fun igs

### Greetings

It will greet you everytime you run it giving you all the info you need like time and date
