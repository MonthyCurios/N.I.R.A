## üîß How It Works

### Voice Recognition

Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to process spoken commands. The system captures audio input, converts it to text, and executes the corresponding action.

### Text-to-Speech

The `pyttsx3` library is used to convert text responses into spoken words, enabling natural and clear communication.

### Weather Information

Fetches weather details for a specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can request current weather conditions and forecasts.

### Joke Fetching

Integrates with an online joke API to provide random jokes for user entertainment and engagement.

### Timer and Alarm

Users can set and manage timers and alarms, with options for customizing alert sounds and durations.

### Gemini Model

Performs search queries and retrieves results using the Gemini Pre trained database. This feature allows users to obtain information from the web directly.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Utilizes `nltk`, `sklearn`, and `Gemini` for advanced NLP and intent classification, enabling sophisticated understanding and responses.

### Bluetooth and NFC Scanning

Scans for and identifies nearby Bluetooth and NFC devices, helping in interacting with various smart devices (may or may not be in the app).

### Dictionary Lookup

Provides definitions, synonyms, and usage examples for words using `PyDictionary`.

### Currency Conversion

Converts amounts between different currencies using the `forex-python` library, assisting users in financial management.

### News Retrieval

Retrieves top news headlines from various sources using the NewsAPI, keeping users updated with current events.

### Conversations

Allows for meaningful conversations with the AI.

### Computer Vision

It can understand what it's seeing and help you either find information about the object or solve a problem (still under development with some errors).

### Rock Paper Scissors

Play rock paper scissors with the AI!

### Coin Flip

Make coin flips for fun!

### Greetings

It will greet you every time you run it, giving you all the info you need, like time and date.

### End-to-End Encryption

Ensures all data transmissions are encrypted, maintaining user privacy and security.
