## 🛠️ Installation and Prerequisites

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/N.I.R.A.git
    cd N.I.R.A
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

    Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    - **On macOS/Linux:**

      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - **On Windows:**

      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configuration**

    - **API Keys**: Obtain API keys for services like Google Custom Search, OpenWeatherMap, and NewsAPI.
    - **Configuration File**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and include your API keys and settings.

    ```plaintext
    # Example .env file
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
    NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
    ```

### 💡 Tips

- **Virtual Environment**: Using a virtual environment helps keep your project's dependencies isolated from other projects.
- **Configuration File**: Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and avoid sharing it publicly.
